            <h2>
                Pandora
            </h2>
            <p>Pandora was the first woman created by the gods, crafted by Hephaestus under Zeus's orders.
                 She was given a box (or jar) containing all the evils of the world and was instructed not to open it. 
                 However, her curiosity led her to open the box, releasing pain, suffering, and other calamities into the world, 
                 leaving only hope inside.
            </li>

            <h2>
            Epimetheus
        </h2>
        <p>Epimetheus, a Titan and the brother of Prometheus, was known for being impulsive and lacking foresight. Despite warnings 
            from his brother, he accepted Pandora as a gift from the gods. His name means "afterthought," reflecting his tendency to act
            without thinking of the consequences, a trait that played a significant role in Pandoraâ€™s story.</p>
    </li>
        <li><h2>Zeus</h2>
        <p>Zeus is the king of the gods in Greek mythology and ruler of Mount Olympus. 
            He is known for wielding thunderbolts and is often associated with justice and order. 
            In the story of Pandora's Box, Zeus created Pandora as a punishment for humanity after Prometheus stole fire from the gods.
